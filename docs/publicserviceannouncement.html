                <h1>What is going on? Why there is a timer?</h1>
                <br>
				<p>
					Typically, for people who don't know why there is a timer at the header, it's all a matter of plagiarism. My friend and I had sent an email to the willing target who was plagiarizing it on full-time. 
					To everyone, you might think this is some bullshit I just put there just for pranks or fun to put on that timer. My reason was because me and my friends were facing this critical isuue with our brands
					usually without our consent.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h1>Okay. Tell us what happened to the people who don't know why we put the timer.</h1>
				<br>
				<p>
					Back in December 2022, my friends overcame a plagiarizer that copied ever aspect of my branding without my consent. A cease-and-desist was first written on his Twitter (aka @graycrown9). Shortly after I sent it,
					my friends hijacked my account on one computer lab at our school, messaging him 2 messages, which those messages are "fuck you" and just only the letter A but smaller. Thank God I still have the copy of cease-and-desist
					to resend on GMail. I was away for around 1 and a half hour, to go to the school canteen just to buy Indomie. Time passed by. Shortly, he replied my email, stating that he was confused. I stated him the reason why. 
					Here is the snippet on what I wrote.
					<br><br>
					<h3><i>
						"You are being infringed of copying my brand without consent."
					</i></h3>
					<br>
					After I wrote that, I was infuriated that by the state, he doesn't know, stating that he never heard of me. I asked him to read the document and gave him 5 days to comply.
					<br><br>
					Around 10 am (UTC+7), he replied with the most tragic message ever against me. This was where the fight started between trademarks.
					<br><br>
					<h3><i>
						"Plagiarizing something that I've made and used for the past 7 years? While your YouTube, Twitter and your merch shop only have been 4, 3, and 1 year respectively? Using the "Stickmin" name as your brand which is owned by PuffballsUnited and InnerSloth? Accusing of plagiarizing a simple color scheme combination that literally hundreds of people use? You don't own those color combinations."
					</i></h3>
					<br>
					I began to laugh internally, stating it was a "goofy ahh message". Typically, he is a street "shitass", stating that I don't own those color combos, but it was all part of the trademark. I even have consulted to the
					local government about this months before the cease-and-desist was sent. I had enough temporarily, giving him another 5 days to comply.
					<br><br>
					My friends and I are looking for competition. I decided to go onto TF2. My corporation, Chocobar (formerly Skoopin Inc.), sent another cease-and-desist. They put the TF2 term there. Here is what the email reads.
					<br><br>
					<h3><i>
						"I would like to say, congratulations on retreating and escaping from Zean's lawsuit. As a final warning, the final match before decision will be made before termination. The game will be Team Fortress 2 and will take place on 2Fort at this Friday at 3PM GMT+7. If you have lost the game, then you will have to rebrand your account. If we lose, we will rebrand our application"
					</i></h3>
					<br>
					Man, I would like to say, he did not agree on the match. He then replied on the following mail.
					<br><br>
					<h3><i>
						"Will you just drop it? I'm not gonna change my name. Why do I need to agree to the TF2 term when I clearly have the disadvantage. This is a lose-lose situation. If I lose, I will lose something, and even if I win, I gain nothing. The right to use my name? The name that I've been using for the past 7 years? The name that I created? Something original that I made in my highschool class 7 years ago? No. You want to name your app "Gray Crown"? Then go ahead."
					</i></h3>
					<br>
					Among us were those chaos. My company sent another email but shortly, it got terminated by Google, which is now resurrected.
					One of my friend, who is a kiger (she also knows a lot about law), told me how to defeat him. She said I could defeat him but I must file for a trademark rights for big companies. Then, my company would now write another letter this morning and I would give him at least
					30 days to comply. I also have to put the timer on to know how much time he has left, before I filed an injuction. Filing will take place at least 2 days before his doomsday.
					So now you know why I put it there and what is the purpose. One more message to all of you guys.
					<br><br>
					<h3><i>
						Please
						<br>
						Don't
						<br>
						Plagiarize
					</i></h3>
