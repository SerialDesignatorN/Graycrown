# Graycrown
A simple game launcher for Windows, macOS and Linux

## Why a rewrite?
The old Graycrown's framework (<1.2.2) is so clutterly. It was oriented around HTML5 and JS. All code has to be collected and interpreted under `main.js`. That script, let alone, resides for insane amount of 735 lines of code, and has not been cleaned up since. Graycrown is undergoing a major rewrite in which all problems are solved, as well as making the app better.
